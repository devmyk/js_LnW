var list = "ted_30days_MattCutts	1	4000	A few years ago, I felt like I was stuck in a rut,/\
ted_30days_MattCutts	4000	9600	so I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American philosopher, Morgan Spurlock,/\
ted_30days_MattCutts	9600	12800	and try something new for 30 days./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	12800	15000	The idea is actually pretty simple./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	15000	18000	Think about something you\'ve always wanted to add to your life/\
ted_30days_MattCutts	18000	21000	and try it for the next 30 days./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	21000	29800	It turns out, 30 days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit like watching the news from your life./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	29800	33800	There\'s a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	33800	40900	The first was, instead of the months flying by, forgotten, the time was much more memorable./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	40900	44600	This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	44600	50000	And I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing that day./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	50000	56500	I also noticed that as I started to do more and harder 30-day challenges, my self-confidence grew./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	56500	63600	I went from desk-dwelling computer nerd to the kind of guy who bikes to work for fun./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	63600	69000	Even last year, I ended up hiking up Mt. Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	69000	75000	I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	75000	82500	I also figured out that if you really want something badly enough, you can do anything for 30 days./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	82500	85000	Have you ever wanted to write a novel?/\
ted_30days_MattCutts	85000	94500	Every November, tens of thousands of people try to write their own 50000 word novel from scratch in 30 days./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	94500	101000	It turns out, all you have to do is write 1,667 words a day for a month./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	101000	103000	So I did./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	103000	108500	By the way, the secret is not to go to sleep until you\'ve written your words for the day./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	108500	112500	You might be sleep-deprived, but you\'ll finish your novel./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	112500	116500	Now is my book the next great American novel?/\
ted_30days_MattCutts	116500	121000	No. I wrote it in a month. It\'s awful./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	121000	126500	But for the rest of my life, if I meet John Hodgman at a ted party,/\
ted_30days_MattCutts	126500	130000	I don\'t have to say, \"I\'m a computer scientist.\"/\
ted_30days_MattCutts	130000	134000	No, no, if I want to, I can say, \"I\'m a novelist.\"/\
ted_30days_MattCutts	136500	139200	So here\'s one last thing I\'d like to mention./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	139200	146000	I learned that when I made small, sustainable changes, things I could keep doing, they were more likely to stick./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	146000	149300	There\'s nothing wrong with big, crazy challenges./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	149300	152000	In fact, they\'re a ton of fun./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	152000	154000	But they\'re less likely to stick./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	154000	159000	When I gave up sugar for 30 days, day 31 looked like this./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	161000	165500	So here\'s my question to you: What are you waiting for?/\
ted_30days_MattCutts	165500	170700	I guarantee you the next 30 days are going to pass whether you like it or not,/\
ted_30days_MattCutts	170700	175600	so why not think about something you have always wanted to try/\
ted_30days_MattCutts	175600	179600	and give it a shot for the next 30 days./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	179600		Thanks.";
