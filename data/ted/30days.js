var list = "ted_30days_MattCutts	0	1000	A few years ago, I felt like I was stuck in a rut,/\
ted_30days_MattCutts	1000	2000	so I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American philosopher, Morgan Spurlock,/\
ted_30days_MattCutts	2000	3000	and try something new for 30 days./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	3000	4000	The idea is actually pretty simple./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	4000	5000	Think about something you've always wanted to add to your life/\
ted_30days_MattCutts	5000	6000	and try it for the next 30 days./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	6000	7000	It turns out, 30 days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit like watching the news from your life./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	7000	8000	There's a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	8000	9000	The first was, instead of the months flying by, forgotten, the time was much more memorable./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	9000	10000	This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	10000	11000	And I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing that day./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	11000	12000	I also noticed that as I started to do more and harder 30-day challenges, my self-confidence grew./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	12000	13000	I went from desk-dwelling computer nerd to the kind of guy who bikes to work for fun./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	13000	14000	Even last year, I ended up hiking up Mt. Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	14000	15000	I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	15000	16000	I also figured out that if you really want something badly enough, you can do anything for 30 days./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	16000	17000	Have you ever wanted to write a novel?/\
ted_30days_MattCutts	17000	18000	Every November, tens of thousands of people try to write their own 50000 word novel from scratch in 30 days./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	18000	19000	It turns out, all you have to do is write 1,667 words a day for a month./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	19000	20000	So I did./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	20000	21000	By the way, the secret is not to go to sleep until you've written your words for the day./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	21000	22000	You might be sleep-deprived, but you'll finish your novel./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	22000	23000	Now is my book the next great American novel?/\
ted_30days_MattCutts	23000	24000	No. I wrote it in a month. It's awful./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	24000	25000	But for the rest of my life, if I meet John Hodgman at a ted party, I don't have to say, \"I'm a computer scientist.\"/\
ted_30days_MattCutts	25000	26000	No, no, if I want to, I can say, \"I'm a novelist.\"/\
ted_30days_MattCutts	26000	27000	So here's one last thing I'd like to mention./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	27000	28000	I learned that when I made small, sustainable changes, things I could keep doing, they were more likely to stick./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	28000	29000	There's nothing wrong with big, crazy challenges./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	29000	30000	In fact, they're a ton of fun./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	30000	31000	But they're less likely to stick./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	31000	32000	When I gave up sugar for 30 days, day 31 looked like this./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	32000	33000	So here's my question to you: What are you waiting for?/\
ted_30days_MattCutts	33000	34000	I guarantee you the next 30 days are going to pass whether you like it or not,/\
ted_30days_MattCutts	34000	35000	so why not think about something you have always wanted to try and give it a shot for the next 30 days./\
ted_30days_MattCutts	35000	36000	Thanks.";
